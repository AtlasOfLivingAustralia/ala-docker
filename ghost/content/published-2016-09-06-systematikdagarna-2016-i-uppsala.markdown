## Programme

Draft programme for Systematikdagarna 21-22 November in Uppsala is now published at http://systematikforeningen.se/verksamhet/systematikdagarna/systematikdagarna-2016/. Registration is also open. Welcome!

For those who want to register to Systematikdagarna and already have an account on systematikforeningen.se: please log in before starting registration.

For those who do not have an account on systematikforeningen.se: you can register for Systematikdagarna without a user account. If you want to create a user account on systematikforeningen.se, you might experience some problems (unfortunately the form doesn’t tell you why your account can’t be created. Common errors include: e-mail address already associated with an account, you forgot one of the mandatory fields, password too short or you didn’t get the last question right. When you have succeeded with your account creation, instead of a “Welcome to Systematikföreningen” e-mail, you might get a “Password changed” confirmation e-mail). Sorry about that, will try to fix it.

Please report any other web site errors to webmaster—snabela—systematikforeningen.se
