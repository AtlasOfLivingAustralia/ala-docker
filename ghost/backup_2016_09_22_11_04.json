One theme is focused on phylogenetics, phylogenomics and bioinformatics, and is intended to provide students with an introduction to these topics, focused on skills that will be useful in their PhD research projects. There will be a mixture of lectures and practicals; students are encouraged to bring their own datasets and analysis problems. The other theme is citizen science and entrepreneurship, and this part of the course will provide broad introductions, exercises, and inspiration for students interested in pursuing these subjects as part of their current or future activities.\n\nThe workshop is primarily aimed at BIG 4 students but (except for the Friday morning session) is open to outside participants as well. We have room for up to 10 additional outside participants on a first come first served basis. Outside participants may choose to come for only part of the course, if they wish.\nCourse registration and fee\n\nRegister for the course no later than September 28 using the form at this web site: http://bit.ly/2c6i6v0. Outside student participation will be confirmed on September 29. If you cancel past that date, we may very well have to charge you the course fee anyway.\n\nThere will be a fee for course, accommodation and food. We expect the total cost to be approximately 2,000 SEK/day for students participating for part of the course, and approximately 15,000 SEK in total for those students taking the entire workshop. Students will receive an invoice after the course is finished.\n\n## Schedule Overview\n\n*Monday October 10*\n\nFredrik Ronquist. Introduction to statistical inference.
