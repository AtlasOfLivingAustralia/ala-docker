# Docker version of Atlas of Living Australia

This is currently Work In Progress! Beware!

# Usage

You need `git`, `make`, `docker` and `docker-compose` (v 1.8 was used). 

Then:

- Clone this repo
- Issue "make"
- Issue "make test"

# Current issues:

collectory.war file needs to be built from scratch rather than pulling it from repo

travis build, maybe
